fixie-wrench-example-app
===============

This is a simple app demonstrating how to use `fixie-wrench`. In this example, HTTP requests to `worldclockapi.com` are proxied though a local port on the Heroku application instance via `fixie-wrench` and then through Fixie Socks.

The same approach can be used to proxy database connections or any other TCP connection.

For more information, see the [fixie-wrench documentation](https://github.com/usefixie/fixie-wrench).
